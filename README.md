# Petstore

Implements the /pet/findByStatus endpoint to accomplish the following:

1. Develop a console application to execute the required sample API(s) to return a list of available Pets from the Pet Store
2. Print a list of available Pets to the console sorted in Categories and displayed in reverse order by Name
3. Write at least one unit test for your code and deliver your code (with instructions in the form a Readme file in markdown) for review

   * Newtonsoft
